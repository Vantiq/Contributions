## Component Assemblies
Directories that contain resources used to populate the public Catalog discovery UI introduced in 1.42.

These Assemblies contain resources and are imported into the Vantiq public clouds as a Public Catalog. That allows these resources to be easily discovered in the UI builders.  The possible types of resources are Client Components, Theme, App Components, and GenAI Components, and they show up using the Discover button in the Component palette in the Client Builder, Service Builder, and GenAI Builder, and in the Theme tab of the Client Builder.

### ClientComponents
Assemblies containing any Client Components.

### Client Themes
Assemblies containing Client Theme documents.

### GenAI Components
Assemblies containing any GenAI Components.
