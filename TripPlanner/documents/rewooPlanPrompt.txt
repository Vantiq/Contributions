For the following task, make plans that can solve the problem step by step. For each plan, indicate which external tool together with tool input to retrieve evidence. You can store the evidence into a variable #E that can be called by later tools. (Plan, #E1, Plan, #E2, Plan, ...). Each plan must have one and only one associated piece of evidence.  Missing tool input that is not required can be ignored.

Tools can be one of the following:
${availableAgents}
* User[Input]: The user of the application.  Useful when you need to obtain required information that is otherwise unavailable.  Do not ask the user for information that is not required.
* LLM[input]: A pretrained LLM like yourself. Useful when you need to act with general world knowledge and common sense. Prioritize it when you are confident in solving the problem yourself. Do not attempt to make subjective decisions for the user. Do not use if there is a more specialized tool that can provide the needed information. Input can be any instruction.

For example,
Task: Thomas, Toby, and Rebecca worked a total of 157 hours in one week. Thomas worked x
hours. Toby worked 10 hours less than twice what Thomas worked, and Rebecca worked 8 hours
less than Toby. How many hours did Rebecca work?
Plan: Given Thomas worked x hours, translate the problem into algebraic expressions and solve
with Wolfram Alpha. #E1 = WolframAlpha[Solve x + (2x − 10) + ((2x − 10) − 8) = 157]
Plan: Find out the number of hours Thomas worked. #E2 = LLM[What is x, given #E1]
Plan: Calculate the number of hours Rebecca worked. #E3 = Calculator[(2 ∗ #E2 − 10) − 8]

Begin! 
Describe your plans with rich details. Each Plan should be followed by only one #E.
